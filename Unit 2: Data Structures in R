Data Activity 2
Using the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 2013-2014: Unrestricted Access Teaching Dataset (see Unit 1), perform the following activities:
Explore whether survey respondents experienced any crime in the 12 months prior to the survey using the variable bcsvictim.
Create a frequency table to count if the survey respondents experienced any crime in the previous 12 months. Use the table() command.
Assess the results and decide if you need to convert this variable into a factor variable. Use as_factor.

1. Assessing the Variable
Structure: bcsvictim is currently stored as a dbl+lbl (a numeric variable with labels), as indicated by the output from str().

Labels: The variable has two categories:

0: Not a victim of crime.

1: Victim of crime.

Frequency:

7460 respondents were not victims of crime.

1383 respondents were victims of crime.

Since this variable represents categorical data, itâ€™s more appropriate to treat it as a factor rather than keeping it as a numeric variable. This ensures that statistical models, summary functions, and visualizations handle it correctly.
2. Convert to Factor Using as_factor()
You can use the as_factor() function from the haven package to convert bcsvictim into a factor while preserving its labels:
> Crime_Survey_for_England_and_Wales$bcsvictim <- as_factor(Crime_Survey_for_England_and_Wales$bcsvictim)
3. Verify the Conversion
After converting, check the structure and levels of the variable:
> str(Crime_Survey_for_England_and_Wales$bcsvictim)
 Factor w/ 2 levels "Not a victim of crime",..: 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 - attr(*, "label")= chr "Experience of any crime in the previous 12 months"
> levels(Crime_Survey_for_England_and_Wales$bcsvictim)
[1] "Not a victim of crime" "Victim of crime"
4. Re-Examine the Frequencies
To confirm that the conversion hasn't altered the data:
> table(Crime_Survey_for_England_and_Wales$bcsvictim)

Not a victim of crime       Victim of crime 
                 7460                  1383 
Now, bcsvictim will be treated as a proper factor variable in your analyses, ensuring clarity and accuracy when interpreting results or visualizing data.
