Data Activity 5
Using the Health_Data, please perform the following functions in R:

Find out mean, median and mode of variables sbp, dbp and income.
Find out the five-figure summary of income variable and present it using a Boxplot.
Run a suitable hypothesis test to see if there is any association between systolic blood pressure and presence and absence of peptic ulcer.

1. Calculate Mean, Median, and Mode of Variables (sbp, dbp, income)
> library(haven)
> Health_Data <- read_sav("C:/Users/arif_/Downloads/Health Data.sav")
> View(Health_Data)

# Calculate mean, median, and mode for sbp, dbp, and income
> mean_sbp <- mean(Health_Data$sbp, na.rm = TRUE) 
> median_sbp <- median(Health_Data$sbp, na.rm = TRUE) 
> mode_sbp <- as.numeric(names(sort(table(Health_Data$sbp), decreasing = TRUE))[1])

> mean_dbp <- mean(Health_Data$dbp, na.rm = TRUE)
> median_dbp <- median(Health_Data$dbp, na.rm = TRUE)
> mode_dbp <- as.numeric(names(sort(table(Health_Data$dbp), decreasing = TRUE))[1])

> mean_income <- mean(Health_Data$income, na.rm = TRUE)
> median_income <- median(Health_Data$income, na.rm = TRUE)
> mode_income <- as.numeric(names(sort(table(Health_Data$income), decreasing = TRUE))[1])

+     income = list(mean = mean_income, median = median_income, mode = mode_income)

2. Five-Number Summary of Income and Boxplot
The five-number summary consists of: minimum, 1st quartile (Q1), median, 3rd quartile (Q3), and maximum.

# Five-figure summary of income
> income_summary <- summary(Health_Data$income)
> print(income_summary)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  52933   68637   86561   85194   99696  117210 

# Boxplot of income
> boxplot(Health_Data$income,
+         main = "Boxplot of Income",
+         xlab = "Income",
+         col = "skyblue",
+         horizontal = TRUE)

3. Hypothesis Test for Association Between SBP and Peptic Ulcer
To test whether there is an association between systolic blood pressure (sbp) and the presence or absence of peptic ulcer (peptic_ulcer), you can use a t-test if peptic_ulcer is a binary variable (e.g., 0 = No, 1 = Yes). This compares the means of sbp for the two groups.
# Perform t-test for sbp and peptic ulcer status
> t_test_result <- t.test(
+     sbp ~ pepticulcer,  # sbp as outcome, pepticulcer as grouping variable
+     data = Health_Data,
+     na.rm = TRUE
+ )
> print(t_test_result)

Interpretation of the Results:

The test will output the means of systolic blood pressure (sbp) for the two groups (peptic ulcer present vs. absent).

The p-value will help determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in sbp between these groups.

Verify Variable Labels: If you'd like, you can reassign meaningful factor labels to make your output more intuitive:
data:  sbp by pepticulcer
t = 1.2142, df = 57.562, p-value = 0.2296
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Yes and group No is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -2.889367 11.795703
sample estimates:
mean in group Yes  mean in group No 
         131.3171          126.8639
