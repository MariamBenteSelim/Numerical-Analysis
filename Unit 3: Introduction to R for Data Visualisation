This week was the most exciting week to start learning programming language R. I downloaded and installed R and R studio. We also had our first seminar held where I related to activities of R. This week I started reading the book Grolemund, G. & Wickham, H. (2017) R for Data Science. Beijing: O'Reilly Part 1 (Chapter 1, 2)
It was a exciting new chapter. I read and re-read as my knowledge with R was lower than the basic.
